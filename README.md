# NC Games Frontend

## Overview

Nc Games is a Reddit Style web app with a focus on board games. The backend usues a PostgreSQL database and allows users to sign in, post reviews, like reviews, comment on reviews and delete their own comments. I built NC Games while on the Northcoders software development bootcamp in May 2023.

The server is hosted via render and is available here: https://nc-games-796w.onrender.com
